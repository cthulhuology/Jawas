About Jawas

Jawas was started around 10 years ago as a project to develop a new general purpose web application
server for the development of a wide variety of online games.  It has been in production for 10 years
now, and has been used by quite a few projects.  This version uses Luajit for scripting on the backend. 
Currently, Jawas supports Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and Linux on 64bit platforms.

Building Jawas

	make

Running Jawas

To run jawas, simply create a directory that contains your websites:

	mkdir -p ~/websites/www.mydomain.com

Place your files in there. And then run jawas from that root directory:

	cd ~/websites && jawasd

Jawas always attempts to keep itself alive if you run it with the -d detach flag:

	cd ~/websites && jawasd -d

Contributing to Jawas

The version of code released under the AGPL has been stripped of a number of features built for specific
clients.   As such, some of the functionality of the production version is currently missing.  If you
would like to contribute code, please email me a patch at:

	dave@dloh.org

If I like your style, I'll add you to the git repository at:

	git://github.com/cthulhuology/Jawas.git

Happy Coding

	Dave Goehrig <dave@dloh.org>
