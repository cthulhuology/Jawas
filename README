About Jawas

Jawas was started around 6 years ago as a project to develop a new general purpose web application
server for the development of a wide variety of online games.  It has been in production for 6 years
now, and has been used by quite a few projects.  It uses a modified version of the SpiderMonkey engine
to provide Javascript scripting on the backend.  Currently, Jawas is geared towards running on
Mac OS X and FreeBSD.  Linux support is iffy.

Building Jawas

	make

Running Jawas

To run jawas, simply create a directory that contains your websites:

	mkdir -p ~/websites/www.mydomain.com

Place your files in there. And then run jawas from that root directory:

	cd ~/websites && jawasd

Jawas always attempts to keep itself alive if you run it with the -d detach flag:

	cd ~/websites && jawasd -d

Contributing to Jawas

The version of code released under the AGPL has been stripped of a number of features built for specific
clients.   As such, some of the functionality of the production version is currently missing.  If you
would like to contribute code, please email me a patch at:

	dave@nexttolast.com

If I like your style, I'll add you to the git repository at:

	git://github.com/cthulhuology/Jawas.git

Happy Coding
